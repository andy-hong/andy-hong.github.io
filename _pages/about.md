I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of City & Metropolitan Planning at the University of Utah. I am also the Director of the [Healthy Aging and Resilient Places Lab](https://www.harp.utah.edu), whose mission is to create healthier and more resilient places for all people across the lifespan. My research focuses on the interplay between the built environment and human health, with a particular interest in the social and environmental determinants of health. My goal is to collaborate with local communities to develop equitable and sustainable place-based approaches to healthy aging and resilient places. I previously held positions at the University of Oxford, the George Institute for Global Health, the University of British Columbia, and the Korea Transport Institute. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Southern California and my graduate and undergraduate studies at the University of Washington.

**Research Interests:** Healthy Cities, Healthy Aging, Age-Friendly Community, Environmental Health, Active Living, Resilient Places
